Julia asked her students to create some coding challenges. Write a query to print the hacker_id, name, and the total number of challenges created by each student. Sort your results by the total number of challenges in descending order. If more than one student created the same number of challenges, then sort the result by hacker_id. If more than one student created the same number of challenges and the count is less than the maximum number of challenges created, then exclude those students from the result.

SOLUTION

SELECT Chal.hacker_id, Hac.name, COUNT(Chal.challenge_id) AS cnt 
FROM Hackers AS Hac 
JOIN Challenges AS Chal
    ON Hac.hacker_id = Chal.hacker_id

GROUP BY Chal.hacker_id, Hac.name

HAVING cnt = (SELECT count(Chal1.challenge_id) FROM Challenges AS Chal1 
              GROUP BY Chal1.hacker_id 
              ORDER BY count(*) desc limit 1) 
              or
       cnt NOT IN (SELECT count(Chal2.challenge_id) FROM Challenges AS Chal2 
                   GROUP BY Chal2.hacker_id 
                   HAVING Chal2.hacker_id <> Chal.hacker_id)

ORDER BY cnt DESC, Chal.hacker_id;
