Given the CITY and COUNTRY tables, query the names of all the continents (COUNTRY.Continent) and their respective average city populations (CITY.Population) rounded down to the nearest integer.

Note: CITY.CountryCode and COUNTRY.Code are matching key columns.

SOLUTION

SELECT Country.Continent, FLOOR(AVG(City.Population))
FROM City
JOIN Country
    ON CITY.CountryCode = COUNTRY.Code
    
GROUP BY Country.Continent
